This is a TTU university project completed by me - a battle ship game using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Please play the game here: http://dijkstra.cs.ttu.ee/~Kaspar.Metsa/prax3/index.html

Details about the game
==============
- The ships only take 2 places and can't be next to each other. Diagonal touching is ok.
- If you bomb some place and it misses there will appear a picture that you missed.

* 1.	There are two different versions: regular and mobile:
* Both versions use the same source code
* The mobile version has these features:
  *	Does not allow zooming in and only allows scrolling up and down, but not to right and left.
  * In mobile, the board is almost from left edge to right edge.
  * In regular version boards are next to each other, in mobile the boards are on top of each othe
